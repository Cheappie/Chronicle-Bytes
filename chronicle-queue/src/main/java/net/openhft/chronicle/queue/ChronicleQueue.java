/**
 * <em>Chronicle</em> (in a generic sense) is a Java project focused on building a persisted low latency messaging
 * framework for high performance and critical applications.
 *
 * <p> Using non-heap storage options <em>Chronicle</em> provides a processing environment where applications does not
 * suffer from <em>GarbageCollection</em>. <em>GarbageCollection</em> (GC) may slow down your critical operations
 * non-deterministically at any time.. In order to avoid non-determinism and escape from GC delays off-heap memory
 * solutions are addressed. The main idea is to manage your memory manually so does not suffer from GC. Chronicle
 * behaves like a management interface over off-heap memory so you can build your own solutions over it.
 *
 * <p><em>Chronicle</em> uses RandomAccessFiles while managing memory and this choice brings lots of possibility. Random
 * access files permit non-sequential, or random, access to a file's contents. To access a file randomly, you open the
 * file, seek a particular location, and read from or write to that file. RandomAccessFiles can be seen as "large"
 * C-type byte arrays that you can access any random index "directly" using pointers. File portions can be used as
 * ByteBuffers if the portion is mapped into memory.
 *
 * <p>{@link ChronicleQueue} (now in the specific sense) is the main interface for management and can
 * be seen as the "Collection class" of the <em>Chronicle</em> environment. You will reserve a portion of memory and
 * then put/fetch/update records using the {@link ChronicleQueue} interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link Excerpt} is the main data container in a {@link ChronicleQueue},
 * each Chronicle is composed of Excerpts. Putting data to a queue means starting a new Excerpt, writing data into
 * it and finishing the Excerpt at the upper.</p>
 *
 * <p>While {@link Excerpt} is a generic purpose container allowing for remote access, it also has
 * more specialized counterparts for sequential operations. See {@link ExcerptTailer} and {@link
 * net.openhft.chronicle.queue.ExcerptAppender}</p>
